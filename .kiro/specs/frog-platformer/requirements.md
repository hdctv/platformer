# Requirements Document

## Introduction

A vertical scrolling platformer game where the player controls a frog character that must jump upward on randomly generated platforms. The game features one-way vertical progression (up only, no going back down), various platform types that introduce different gameplay mechanics, and progressive difficulty through platform type variations based on player progress.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to control a frog character that can jump between platforms, so that I can navigate through the vertical game world.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player presses the jump key THEN the frog SHALL perform a jump with realistic physics
2. WHEN the frog lands on a platform THEN the frog SHALL be able to stand on it and prepare for the next jump
3. WHEN the frog is in mid-air THEN the frog SHALL be affected by gravity and fall downward
4. WHEN the player provides a distinct left/right input THEN the frog SHALL move left/right respectively

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want the screen to scroll upward automatically, so that I am constantly challenged to keep climbing higher.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game is running THEN the screen SHALL continuously scroll upward at a constant speed
2. WHEN the frog falls below the bottom of the screen THEN the game SHALL end
3. WHEN the screen scrolls THEN platforms below the visible area SHALL be removed from memory
4. WHEN the screen scrolls THEN the frog SHALL not be able to move downward beyond the current view

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want platforms to be randomly generated, so that each playthrough offers a unique challenge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game starts THEN platforms SHALL be randomly placed at different heights and horizontal positions
2. WHEN new platforms are needed THEN they SHALL be generated above the current visible area
3. WHEN platforms are generated THEN they SHALL be spaced appropriately to allow jumping between them
4. WHEN platforms are generated THEN they SHALL ensure the game remains playable (no impossible gaps)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want different types of platforms to appear as I progress, so that the gameplay becomes more challenging and varied.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player reaches certain progress milestones THEN new platform types SHALL be introduced
2. WHEN a slippery platform is encountered THEN the frog SHALL have reduced friction and slide more easily
3. WHEN a breakable platform is stepped on THEN it SHALL break after a short delay
4. WHEN a moving platform is present THEN it SHALL move horizontally back and forth
5. WHEN a harmful platform is touched THEN the frog SHALL take damage or lose a life
6. WHEN progress increases THEN the variety and frequency of special platform types SHALL increase

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want clear visual feedback about my progress and game state, so that I can understand my performance and current situation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game is running THEN the current height/score SHALL be displayed on screen
2. WHEN different platform types are present THEN they SHALL be visually distinct from each other
3. WHEN the frog is on different platform types THEN appropriate visual or audio feedback SHALL be provided
4. WHEN the game ends THEN the final score and game over screen SHALL be displayed

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a player, I want smooth and responsive controls, so that I can precisely control the frog's movement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN input is received THEN the frog SHALL respond immediately without noticeable delay
2. WHEN the frog jumps THEN the jump height and arc SHALL feel natural and predictable
3. WHEN the frog lands THEN the landing SHALL feel solid and provide good feedback
4. WHEN multiple inputs are pressed THEN they SHALL be handled appropriately without conflicts
